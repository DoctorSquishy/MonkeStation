changes:
  - bugfix: Security Records should no longer have to apply prefs to a random dummy
      to generate pictures for every character that joins the round.
  - bugfix: sechud/medhud buttons in examines now time out after 1 minute. This means
      that a single examine will no longer allow you to track someone's identity and/or
      health for the rest of the round.
  - refactor: Refactored the manifest code to not rely on generating two photo of
      each character at roundstart. This means that the start of the game should be
      significantly faster.
  - bugfix: The images shown in the manifest no longer look crummy, and will instead
      look exactly like you'd expect them to!
