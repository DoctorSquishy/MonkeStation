changes:
  - bugfix: The Crew Monitor should no longer stop functioning when Doctor Hilbert
      hangs out in nullspace, and should continue to work despite any similar errors
      in the future.
  - bugfix: picking up and dropping additional uniforms will no longer remove you
      from crew monitor
